# Colonies
A Towny inspired land claim plugin, but with different features

To compile:

Install Maven 3.6: https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.6.0/release-notes.html

cd into Colonies directory. run `mvn clean install`


# Current State:

Currently able to create/delete Colonies and claim/unclaim land.
Multiple forms of grief protection are in place with more being added.

# ToDo:

Save data to a back end. MySQL is partially implemented, FlatFile support will follow.
Organize permissions and create groups. Ex: Ruler, Citizen, etc. And allow each to only be able to do certain things.
